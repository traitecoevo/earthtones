Date: 2016-08-31
Description: This package downloads a satellite image via Google Earth (these are
    often originally from Landsat), 
    translates the image into a perceptually uniform color space,
    runs one of a few different clustering algorithms on the colors in the image 
    searching for a user-supplied number of colors,
    and returns the resulting color palette.
