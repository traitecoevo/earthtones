Description: Downloads a satellite image via ESRI and maptiles (these are
    originally from a variety of aerial photography sources), 
    translates the image into a perceptually uniform color space,
    runs one of a few different clustering algorithms on the colors in the image 
    searching for a user-supplied number of colors,
    and returns the resulting color palette.
